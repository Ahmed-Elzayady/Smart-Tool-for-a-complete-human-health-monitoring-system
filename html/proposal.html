            We need a tool to measure temperature, Heartbeat, puls detection
            blood oxygen concentration , pressure and random diabetic test for
            human , all of these in a small robot to save time ,for people who
            can’t read, it can talk to tell them their information about their
            body, if you aren’t well, our tool will tell you . Applicants shall

            The problem we suffer from under the conditions of Corona, the
            person must take distances between him and others to avoid infection
            and because of the problems of pressure on hospitals, so we designed
            this project to help Egyptian and military hospitals throughout dear
            Egypt

          <p class="fg">
            By using this device, we can reduce the pressure on hospitals from
            overcrowding, as this device can be placed in the streets and
            squares and be available for use by anyone, especially in these
            difficult circumstances.

            We chose this project because of its great benefit and service to
            the community and helping patients to check on their health
            Efficiently and accurately. and To provide an easy and quick way to
            know the vital processes of the human body, such as blood pressure,
            heart rate, temperature, etc., and to check on health in general.

          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Medical devices are an important means for both the prevention and
            treatment of diseases in a safe and effective manner at the same
            time, as achieving these goals requires good management and use by
            the user of these devices, and thus ensures the improvement of the
            course of the health medical process and its quality in line with
            the goals of patients to reach treatment Effective, efficiently and
            comfortably , And also to medical devices and equipment includes
            major roles in providing optimal care to patients, which will be
            mentioned here: Detection and early diagnosis of the problem in its
            early stages, which helps doctors provide the best possible care.
            Accurate and detailed results of the diseased condition as soon as
            possible. Examination and measurement of patients' vital signs.
            Careful follow up of each diseased case, and identification of the
            most important possibilities available to reduce pathological
            dimensions.Providing high resolution images of the surgical site,
            which helps the medical staff to perform surgeries with ease.
            Reducing medical errors and complications related to the
            implementation of complex medical operations, as robots and
            precision devices work to reduce negative effects. Treating life
            threatening conditions such as irregular heartbeat. Reducing the
            risk of infection by minimizing and minimizing surgical
            intervention. Healing and recovering quickly, which reduces the
            length of stay in the hospital. Improving the overall quality of the
            medical system and healthcare providers In short, it is a tool for
            measuring the temperature of the human body, blood pressure, the
            number of heart beats, and the percentage of oxygen in the blood for
            all groups and ages, visually and audibly.

            We aspire in the near future to be able to increase the capacity of
            this project by measuring blood sugar and blood pressure, as well as
            activating the mask mode, as it is a camera that monitors the person
            using the device, as the device did not work unless the person was
            wearing a mask, in order to preserve our health

      <h2>the most important sensor ECG sensor</h2>
      <p class="ECG">
        ECG (electrocardiography) is a method of collecting electrical
        signals generated by the heart. This allows us to understand the
        level of physiological arousal that someone is experiencing, but it
        can also be used to better understand someone’s psychological state.
