            We need a tool to measure temperature, Heartbeat, puls detection
            blood oxygen concentration , pressure and random diabetic test for
            human , all of these in a small robot to save time ,for people who
            can’t read, it can talk to tell them their information about their

            We chose this project because of its great benefit and service to
            the community and helping patients to check on their health
            Efficiently and accurately. and To provide an easy and quick way to
            know the vital processes of the human body, such as blood pressure,
            heart rate, temperature, etc., and to check on health in general.

            Medical devices are an important means for both the prevention and
            treatment of diseases in a safe and effective manner at the same
            time, as achieving these goals requires good management and use by
            the user of these devices, and thus ensures the improvement of the
            course of the health medical process and its quality in line with
            the goals of patients to reach treatment Effective, efficiently and
            comfortably , And also to medical devices and equipment includes
            major roles in providing optimal care to patients, which will be
            mentioned here: Detection and early diagnosis of the problem in its
            early stages, which helps doctors provide the best possible care.
            Accurate and detailed results of the diseased condition as soon as
            possible. Examination and measurement of patients' vital signs.
            Careful follow up of each diseased case, and identification of the
            most important possibilities available to reduce pathological
            dimensions.Providing high resolution images of the surgical site,
            which helps the medical staff to perform surgeries with ease.
            Reducing medical errors and complications related to the
            implementation of complex medical operations, as robots and
            precision devices work to reduce negative effects. Treating life
            threatening conditions such as irregular heartbeat. Reducing the
            risk of infection by minimizing and minimizing surgical
            intervention. Healing and recovering quickly, which reduces the
            length of stay in the hospital. Improving the overall quality of the
            medical system and healthcare providers In short, it is a tool for
            measuring the temperature of the human body, blood pressure, the
            number of heart beats, and the percentage of oxygen in the blood for
            all groups and ages, visually and audibly.
